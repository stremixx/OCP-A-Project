            It opens up new possibilities for us to explore differnt sounds, and
            the ability to adquire new tastes. Music can also also become a hobby, and
            somtimes even a profession.

            <p>Music has allowed me to go so many places I never would of been to, in fact the very first time
                I visited Disney World was with my orchestra, and being in there because of my music made me feel very proud.
                I play the violin and I have been playing for quite some time now, more than ten years, and during that time, I have meet
                countless people, learned new instruments and skills, have become better at math, at listening for specific tones,
                and I discovered a whole new world of music and so many possibilities and generes that I might of never been exposed to.
