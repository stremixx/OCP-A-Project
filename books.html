        <h3>The Change Books Have Brought</h3>
        <p>
            Outside of academic obligations, I never truly felt inclined to read for pleasure.
        </p>
        <p>
            That being said, one day I decided to give reading another chance.
            I had always been searching for new ways to enjoy my hobbies,
            but I frequently found it difficult to stay concentrated and motivated. At the time,
            most of my free time was spent on movies, video games,
            and occasional computer or programming activities. While enjoyable,
            these pursuits often felt unbalanced—some taking more of my time than they should have,
            and few offering the sense of productivity or depth I longed for.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite my past difficulties, I finally committed to trying reading again—and I am so grateful that I did,
            because it has completely transformed my life.
