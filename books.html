        <p>I always struggled to read, and it was very difficult for me to find motivation
            to go and pickup a book, I always read the neccesary books in school
            for my english courses, but never in my own time did I feel inclined to
            pickup a book. 

            <p>That is untill one day, I decided to give reading another chance, I was always
                looking for differnt ways to enjoy my different hobbies, but I always found it
                difficult
